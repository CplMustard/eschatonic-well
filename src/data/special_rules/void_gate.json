    "text": "Throughout a game of Warcaster: Neo-Mechanika, players will deploy units into play through their void gates.\nOnce per turn at the end of the Deployment Phase after deploying models, a player can nominate one friendly warrior model to place a void gate or may place a void gate anywhere within 5” of their side of the table. A model that was deployed this turn cannot be nominated to place a gate. After nominating a friendly warrior model to place a void gate, the gate may be placed anywhere within 5” of that model.\nWhen a player places a void gate, they must charge it with at least 1 Arc and can charge it with up to 5 Arc. A player can have up to two void gates in play at any time.\nOnce placed, void gates remain on the battlefield until they collapse. Void gates are considered to be 30mm-based models and can be attacked by enemy units. Void gates have DEF 3 and ARM 5. When a gate is damaged, instead of subtracting Health, clear 1 Arc from the gate for each damage point it would have suffered. If a void gate is cleared of its last Arc, it collapses and is removed from play.\nA model can move through a void gate but cannot stop its movement on a gate. If it does not have enough movement to cross the void gate, the model must stop short of the gate."
