    "text": "A mantlet is a deployable barrier.\nMantlets are not units or warrior models and cannot be charged. They cannot move or attack, do not activate, and are not on bases.\nMantlets have a Deployment Cost and are deployed like unit models. When a mantlet is deployed, place it within 1\" of the void gate as normal. A player can have up to four mantlets in play at any time.\nMantlets provide cover like obstacle terrain features. Mantlets never gain cover.\nA friendly model can move through a mantlet if it has enough SPD to completely move through it.\nBecause they grant cover and do not have a fixed base size defining their volume, mantlet models cannot be customized or modified in any way aside from their paint job."
