If the target is hit, before damage is rolled, the model hit is slammed directly away from the attacking model. Roll a number of Action Dice equal to this model's STR. For every strike rolled, move the model hit 1\". The model hit suffers a damage roll equal with a POW equal to this model's STR. Collateral damage is equal to this model's STR."
